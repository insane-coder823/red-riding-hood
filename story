Once there was girl called Riding Hood. She liked walking in the forest. One day she was walking in the
 forest and she heard a sound coming from the bushes. She went to check and see what it was but there 
was nothing there. But there was something there, it was the wolf. Riding started to go bac home but 
the wolf knew this and dressed up as her grandmother. When Riding Hood reached back home she saw the
wolf but he was dressed up as her grandmother so she didn't notice anything. Then the wolf pounced
 on Riding but her real grandmother came and stopped the wold from hurting Riding Hood. The wolf got
very scared and then ran away.daaaaaaaasdddddddwa dasdwads. grrkyknmry.afffffffffffdsfar
